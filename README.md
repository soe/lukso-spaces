A social space is a LSP7 digital asset/contract which supports creation of social elements (blog, post, musing, etc) and interactions with these items (reply, comment, reactions, up/down votes, etc).

The contract is deployed at `0x344772c70B624F91c52a1AB162E8A070319274fB`

Taking reference to Lukso team's reference `example-forum-dapp`, a more gas-efficient and more extensible social dapp building block is tinkered.
Hence this project has been pursued. I have managed to reduced gas fees by 40% to 60% while delivering more extensibility and features.
